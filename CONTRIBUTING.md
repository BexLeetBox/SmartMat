# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We would appreciate greatly if you used the following convention for contributing.

## Commit Message Format

To ensure that our commit history is clear, concise, and easy to follow, we ask that you use the following commit message format:

keyword: present tense description

Optional additional description.


The keyword should be one of the following:

- `feat` (for new features)
- `fix` (for bug fixes)
- `docs` (for documentation changes)
- `style` (for formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.; no code change)
- `refactor` (for refactoring production code)
- `test` (for adding or updating tests; no production code change)
- `chore` (for updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.; no production code change)

The present tense description should be a short summary of the changes made in the commit. If needed, you can provide additional information in the optional description section.

Here's an example of a commit message using this format:

feat: add list of items

This commit adds a new feature to the application: a list of items that users can view and interact with.


## Branch Naming Convention

We also ask that you follow a specific naming convention when creating new branches for your contributions. Please use the following format:

keyword/purpose-of-branch


The keyword should be the same as the one used in your commit message (e.g. `feat`, `fix`, etc.), and the purpose-of-branch should be a short description of the branch's purpose (e.g. `add-list-of-items`, `fix-broken-link`, etc.).

Here's an example of a branch name using this format:


feat/add-list-of-items


## Conclusion

We hope these guidelines make it easier for you to contribute to our project! If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to working with you!
